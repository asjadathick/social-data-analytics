After many calls to Telstra, and nothing being followed up, I wrote an email outlining my concerns on February 10th - still waiting for a reply or contact of some kind. 
Called again 15th February
Called again 26th February. 
Called again 4th March - this call was successful in getting email up and running. So the 2hours 43mins did finally get something achieved. 
Today is 21st March, so I think I am not overreacting in wanting some action with this manner FAST!

Hi,  just wanted to thank you for driving me away from your service. Beacuse of your incompetence and ability, in understanding what I wanted as your customer. 

I am now enjoying a more realiable service from your direct competitor. The best thing about this is that I now got more for less. 

Anyway after spending 10 years as a loyal customer and being treated like rubbish I am grateful for you in showimg me how bad you really are and that their are better providers than you. But lets be honest it doesn't take much to be better than you.

Everything was just so hard for you. I have been on the phone to you for an hour already. All I want to do is pay my money to you so I never have to wait and deal with you again but even taking my money seems hard.

If only you listened to me I would be none to the wiser and still be happy in paying my bills.",,status,,https://www.facebook.com/Telstra/posts/10154599497149315,2017-03-21 06:56:53,3,2,2,0,1,0,2,0,0

9322764314_10154599490474315,"My family and I have been trying to sign up for an Internet-Phone bundle with Telstra ever since 21st of November 2016. 
2 Months after finalising the plan I was advised that I must provide a proof-of-occupancy, nothing wrong with that, though this was advised to us when I made the initiative to call the business and spend HOURS on the phone wondering why the services had not begun, on the 28th OF JANUARY 2017. 
After providing the document, a representative called me and tells me that the document is insufficient as a proof-of-occupancy. Where I tell him that ""my case manager, Elaine, had advised us to send that document and if there is any problem, could I kindly speak to her"".
Weeks passed and I received NO calls and NO emails from Telstra regarding this issue! 
Out of a sudden the business decided to go through with the connection without letting us know.
Meanwhile we are out of Internet and any Phone services for which I called Iprimus (Current Internet Provider) to ask them why do we have no internet?? 
They advised us that Telstra had disconnected our services with Iprimus. Mind you that we have no knowledge of this as NO ONE informed us and I was under the impression that I may need to provide another proof-of-occupancy document. 
After discontenting our services WITHOUT our consent, on the 15th of March, we were told that the services will return on the 21st of March. Till then we can buy a dongle for $240, from a Telstra shop that they MAY credit us for when the billing cycle resumes.  
Today I received a call from a Senior Supervisor Mac who tells me, and I quote ""that he is NOT sure when the services will return and that he can't do anything about it"".  
Amongst my family members and I who work at home and study online, are forced to use our phone internet to get some, if any, work done!! 
Telstra has severely disrupted our lifestyle with their distorted communication and dishonest staff members. I pledge to anyone who can offer me a solution as I am NOT willing to put up with nuisance any longer!!

It turns out, however, that you don't do travel passes for Hawaii. This strikes me as very odd because the USA is listed as a country that you do travel passes for and doesn't include an indication that you exclude any of its states. Pretty frustrating considering everyone else in my group are able to get great roaming deals but I don't because I'm a Telstra customer. 

This is the first time in about 5-6 years as a Telstra customer that I'm considering going with a different company. I'm a travel agent and need to be able to have international roaming at an affordable rate when I'm travelling and when Vodafone do $5 per day, you're just not competitive.
